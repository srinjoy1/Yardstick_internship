AI/ML Developer - Internship Assignment
Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your AI development skills by creating and optimizing a Question-Answer (QA) bot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Additionally, you'll be tasked with preparing datasets for AI model fine-tuning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the QA bot.

Task Overview:
Develop a QA Bot using RAG:

Implement a system that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers to questions.
The system should efficiently search a knowledge base and generate responses based on the retrieved information.
Prepare Datasets for Fine-Tuning:

Curate and preprocess datasets to fine-tune the AI model, ensuring it improves over time.
Use relevant data and ensure it aligns with the specific domain the QA bot is designed for.
Optimization:

Optimize the performance of the QA bot for better response time and accuracy.
Experiment with different hyperparameters and configurations to achieve the best results.
Technologies Used:
OpenAI API: To integrate the language model for RAG.
Pinecone DB: For efficient and scalable vector search.
Google Colab: For notebook-based implementation and submission.
Python: Primary programming language for implementing the bot and preprocessing datasets.
Libraries: pandas, numpy, openai, pinecone-client, transformers, etc.
Evaluation Criteria:
Relevance: The accuracy and effectiveness of the QA bot in providing meaningful answers.
Technical Accuracy: Proper use of RAG and other technologies, ensuring that the solution is technically sound.
Clarity: Clean, well-documented, and easy-to-understand code.
Creativity: Innovative approaches to enhance the bot's functionality and performance.
How to Use:
Clone this repository.
Open the notebook QA_Bot_RAG.ipynb in Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code and test the QA bot.
Prepare and load your datasets as per the instructions to fine-tune the model.
Submission:
Submit the final Colab notebook containing the implemented solution, along with any relevant datasets and model files.
Ensure that your code is well-documented, with explanations for key sections.
